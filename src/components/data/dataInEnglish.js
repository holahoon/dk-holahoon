    <h2>I'm a front-end developer, David Kim.</h2>
    <p>
      It all started with "hello world" that changed my entire life to walk the
      'infinite learning journey' of a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a digital marketing agnecy located in Duluth, GA where I took my first
      step as a front-end developer, I have built strong trust and relationships
      with coworkers and by maintaining clear communications to make sure all
      the work tickets get delivered on time. Outside of work, I always look for
      opportunities to improve my skills by learning and building side projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also experienced collaborating with a designer on developing
      projects which helped me to open my eyes to pay closer attention to
      details. I usually decide to use ReactJS as it is my all-time favorite
      stack because I simply cannot resist the beauty of JSX.

    <p>
      In the midst of an awful global pandemic (COVID 19), I have decided to
      take the risk to leave America and settle in South Korea to seek
      opportunities as a developer and experience new/different life style.

      I'm currently open & actively seeking for opportunities to grow together.{" "}
